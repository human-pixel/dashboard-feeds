## Dashboard Feeds allows you to replace the WordPress news feeds in the dashboard with your very own.

This is one of the easiest ways to personalize the dashboard and make users feel right at home on your site. Usually, after logging onto WordPress users see a snapshot of their site, can make a post with QuickPress, and are given two WordPress specific RSS feeds. Replace the WordPress Development feed with your own:

On the Settings page you will see the default Primary and Secondary forms for the RSS Widgets. These are provided by WordPress and cannot be deleted. However they can be changed. You can also add more than the default two widgets. You can have as many RSS widgets as you want.
